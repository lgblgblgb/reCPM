This directory contains buch of files, which are basically MD (markdown) format.
However, please note, that the intent of these files, to be built into the
reCPM executables, to implement a crude internal CLI help system. Thus, these
files have quite rigid format, restricted within the MD format capabilities.
Be careful if you plan to modify any. The Makefile mechanism will convert the
*.md files in this directory into C string, which will be compiled into the
binary directly. Maybe you can argue, how lame this method is. But the truth,
that reCPM wants to be a single-executable extra easy to deply quick little
solution. This method to embbed help is indeed ugly, and searching in it is
not the fastest method, but we don't need hundred of megabytes of documentation
here anyway ...
