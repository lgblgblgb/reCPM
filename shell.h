/* This is a MINIMAL CP/M emulator. That is, it emulates a Z80 (though 8080 would be
   enough for most CP/M software), the BDOS and the CBIOS as well, and just expects
   a CP/M program to load and run. It was written *ONLY FOR* running some ancient
   tools, namely M80 assembler and L80 linker (they don't seem to have modern versions
   for non-CP/M OSes). The emulator has BDOS/CBIOS functions implemented and in a way
   that is enough for these tools! Maybe this can change in the future, but this is the
   current situation! Stderr should be redirected, as those are DEBUG messages.
